% \frame{\frametitle{Balance/Representativeness}
% 
%         % Representativeness is, simply:
%         Maximising the extent to which a sample resembles the population
% 
%         % For a given question 
%         % For a given population (needs defining)
% 
% 
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item \textbf{Balance/Proportionality}---The ability of each sample to relate to its real-world counterpart
%                 % As seen in some given dimension
%                     
%             \item \textbf{Size}---The ability to adequately represent sub-populations fully for subsampling and specific inquiry
%                 % i.e. is there enough data on a given subtype of language?
%         \end{itemize}
% 
%         Language is so complex that, to satisfy these for a given research question, we require a very large sampe size

\section{Sampling Design}



\subsection{Conventional Sampling}
\frame{\frametitle{Conventional Corpus Design}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Samples texts as instances of a persistent construct
            \vspace{10pt}
    % i.e. books themselves, rather than the act of reading

\item Stratified along genre, medium, etc.
            \vspace{10pt}
    % This differs from social science samples, who usually use variation across
    % the social population
    % 
    % There's a fair amount of disagreement on what variables are most important still
    %
    % It's not possible to sample consumption/production without having better information on these

\item Based on available indexes such as bestseller lists
            \vspace{10pt}
    % i.e. bestseller lists, etc

\item Tightly coupled to expert opinion on text importance
    % Which lists to use, etc, is chosen by committee
    % these have direct influence on content (selecting more books, for example)

\end{itemize}

\note{
    BNC: "Texts were chosen for inclusion according to three selection features: domain (subject field), time (within certain dates) and medium (book, periodical, etc.)."
}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Difficulties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many variables don't have indexes
            \vspace{10pt}
            % (i.e. production vs consumption)
        \item Ethical or legal concerns limit some types of data
            \vspace{10pt}
            % i.e. speech vs writing proportions
        \item Selection using `proxy variables', due to lack of auxiliary data
            \vspace{10pt}
            % and these have interactions with other variables of interest, i.e. p[in index list] correlates with some social/linguistic property
        \item True empirical distribution of many variables is unknown
            % leading to unrepresentative choices for stratum size
            % such as time authored/read vs "was made in this year"
    \end{itemize}

% TODO: the slide below 
% \subsection{Literature}

%         \item Varadi
%         \item Leech
%         \item
%     \end{itemize}
% \note{}
% }

% NOTE: another approach here would be to send out questionnaires in order to assess
%       the social validity of corpus results, i.e. to check the indexes.

\subsection{Demographic Sampling}
\frame{\frametitle{Demographic Sampling}
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item Views language use as a social event
            \vspace{10pt}
% a language transaction, a la Leech

\item Stratified along demographic variables
            \vspace{10pt}
% as in the BNC's demographic speech sample
% as with virtually all other social science samples

\item Expert opinion only needed to select demographics
            \vspace{10pt}
% though sample size is still a hot topic and always will be
% population is now "all users of x language",
% the users can be determined through other surveys

\item Opportunities for census of language genres
% Constant recording can record everything, for once
% Personal corpus stuff.

\end{itemize}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item 

    %     \item Selecting different variables of interest re-orients many practical issues
    %     % back to basics --- what is the aim of CL?
    %     \item I've chosen to sample language as a social, transitive, event
    %         % i.e. for a given group of people, what language do they use?
    %     \item Sample proportions of language use 'in the wild'
    %     \item With sufficient sample size, this is equivalent, however, pragmatic sampling issues differ greatly
    % \end{itemize}
\note{}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Advantages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Social demographics are well documented
            \vspace{10pt}
        \item No central index is required 
            \vspace{10pt}
            % The person is a central index
        \item Additional variables are exposed to study
            \vspace{10pt}
            % production/consumption, time/context etc.
            % more variables, i.e. not only author/title/genre (which may still be there),
            % but also social ones and transitive ones
        \item Discovery of language types/uses possible
            % ephemera, TV, labels, billboards etc

    \end{itemize}

\note{}
}


\frame{\frametitle{New Difficulties}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sampling text from many people is technically demanding, expensive
            \vspace{10pt}
            % We have to leave the office more
            % technology makes this easier nowadays
            % This is also an issue for things like the BHPS
        \item Size issues now affect `how many people'
            \vspace{10pt}
            % difficult even for simple data
            % dependent on the variability of people's everyday usage (a la biber)
        \item Multi-modal sources require transcription 
            % but this can be helped by using the sample as auxiliary data
            % Many things don't start of so well curated

I read a very eclectic mix of things, including:
            % In one day, for example, I read articles on music theory, a guidebook for climbers, food cooking instructions, brand names on many items of clothing and food, instructions for how to do various things, GPS instructions and maps, and road signs.
            % This implies that a good representative sample will require a lot more text than first suspected
            % Low signal-noise ratio: That is, a corpus will have to grow rather large before it includes any whole books, let alone a cross-section of genres.

\frame{\frametitle{Findings --- Methodological}
Proper annotation requires a fair amount of neurolinguistic knowledge:
            \vspace{10pt}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How often does one read a document when writing it?
        \item How deliberately must one read something for it to `count'?
        \item What's the best method of recording multiple parallel activities?
        \item What of programming languages, music, numeric and symbolic information, maps, etc.?
    \end{itemize}
\note{}

\subsection*{Ethics}
\frame{\frametitle{Ethics}
Covert research is always ethically suspect, however:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data being captured is not sensitive
        \item There is no other way to capture small spoken utterances
        \item Little to no human listening ever occurs on the resultant data
        \item Automated obfuscation is possible if only taking word counts/proportions
            % such as garbling the speech without affecting frequencies, allowing VAD to still work
        \item Data may be optionally deleted after (nightly) notation in the log 
            % unless sampling verbatim recordings, any data sampled may be deleted after its main points have been
            % noted down.
    \end{itemize}
\note{
  BNC: announced their recordings and allowed for deletion on request

\section*{Summary}
\frame{\frametitle{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One preliminary test complete 
        \item Sampling methods need refinement, but show promise
        \item Annotation should be continuous in order to reduce bulk of transcription effort
        \item Though a single-person sample is useful, multiple people could augment data using questionnaires and data mining
        
        \vspace{10pt}
        \item I welcome questions/feedback on methods for the next round of sampling!
    \end{itemize}
