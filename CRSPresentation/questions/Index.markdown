Summary
-------

 * Check out the Czech National Corpus, who used reception-only sampling.
 * Attempt more automated processing to allow others to build personal corpora
 * Sampling of 'weird' text types of particular interest (labels, etc)
 * Partial recording is troublesome --- perhaps use eye/scroll tracking?
