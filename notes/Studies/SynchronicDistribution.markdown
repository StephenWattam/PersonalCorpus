Synchronic Distribution
=======================
Synchronic corpora are sampled within a given time frame (i.e. 1961).  Check the dispersion of items seen in everyday usage to record their age and compare it against the age of items in a corpus.

In theory, there will be a trailing off back into the 1800s, from which I will seldom read anything.

In addition to this, extend the analysis with a comparison of the main text
types: some will doubtless be older than others, and some will be almost entirely brand new (spoken).

Research Questions
------------------

1. What is the proportional distribution through time of language use (for my demographic)?
2. How much does each text type vary in its temporal distribution?
3. How does this compare to synchronic corpus studies' samples?
4. How does the distribution vary corpus-corpus (using references, perhaps a monitor corpus)

Challenges
----------

1. Only one person.  Inter-person variance is thus not known.  Could be
    estimated using (perhaps) a monitor corpus.
2. How does one decide how old a text is?
3. Is it possible to extract age data from a monitor corpus without the ages all being '0' (using references etc)?
4. The findings would be very heavily biased by the proportions of text types, and would need to be controlled for this.
5. Because of the heavily skew distribution expected, it may be necessary to collect a large amount of data before it's possible to extract any clear results.
