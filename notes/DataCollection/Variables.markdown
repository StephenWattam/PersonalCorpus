Variables of Interest
=====================
The parameters I wish to record must be aligned to the main degrees of variation in language (external) as judged by the linguistic community.  Thus most properties will be centred around issues of genre and purpose.

For comparison to other corpora, properties such as the publication date, number of recipients, and other external variables should also be recorded.

The purpose of this document is to identify, in a reasoned manner, the set of variables which are to be of most interest.  For this I will refer both to the aims of the study, and to 'corpora in general', where EAGLES acts as a useful (if vague) summary.

Though ultimately these will need to be well defined, they should remain loose enough to permit some discovery during preliminary tests.

External
--------
External variables of interest are aligned with those used in other corpora.  This raises a number of important and difficult to finalise questions regarding the taxonomy of genres and labels used, however, many of these may be decided in a post-hoc manner providing sufficient information is recorded to jog the experimenter's memory.

It should also be noted that there is a pragmatic limitation to recording many variables about a text, as much of the recording process will be manual.  This merely serves to increase the importance of selecting useful, generalisable and informative items.

EAGLES' recommendations for external variables cover three categories: *origin*, *state*, and *aims*.

Internal
--------
Internal variables are of less interest for this particular study:

 1. They may be inferred by looking up texts conforming to the external variables (if said external variables are properly selected);
 2. The content of much language use causes or exacerbates many of the ethical issues

As such, recording the exact text experienced will be something that is restricted by pragmatic issues.  With luck, many of these can be circumvented (see [data sources](DataSources), however, it seems likely that a lot will be missed.

EAGLES' recommendations cover very basic distinctions: *topic*, and *style*.  Neither of these are particularly well defined.

Selection
---------
As a first estimate, the following ought to be recorded (based on [EAGLES](http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/texttyp/node16.html#SECTION00050000000000000000) '96, [Atkins, Clear & Ostler](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/1/1.abstract) '92):

1. *Genre*---Quite what demarkation to make between the genres is unclear.  Given the uniqueness of the corpus structure, it may be wise to determine this using exploratory techniques (perhaps grounded theory?)
2. *Date of publication*/*Age*---This may be difficult to ascertain, and will likely be the current date for many sources of text.
3. *Author*---The author, or author *type* (company, shared, individual, etc.) will most certainly be of interest
4. *Mode*/*Format*/*Medium*---Of special interest to this corpus, the medium is likely to vary more than most, and will probably include items such as 'billboard' or 'poster'
5. *Setting*---The social context of the text (home, education, etc.).  This could be assigned after the fact with relative ease.
6. *Size of intended readership*---Of particular interest due to the production/consumption differentiation in corpora.
