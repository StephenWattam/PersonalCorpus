Amendments to Sampling Procedure (1)
====================================
This document includes amendments to the original [preliminary sampling procedures](PreliminaryProcedures), based on the [preliminary report](PreliminaryReport).  It covers solutions to a number of practical issues, and should not replace the original sampling procedures so much as augment and correct them.

Aims
----
Except in circumstances where the text is recallable (books, etc), sampling should focus on creating records of:

 * The identity of the text, sufficient to identify its genre and likely linguistic content for later retrieval or analogue
 * The parameters of its absorbsion or creation (length, attention, purpose)

This is merely a clarification of the original aims: it is simply impractical to acquire the verbatim text for many documents, and those that may be sampled fully will be over-represented due to the partial consumption thereof.


Variables
---------
Time-keyed lookup of variables proved to be remarkably important to constructing an idea of what went on in a given day.  This concept of a series of actions in a conventional diary format can then be used to augment and contextualise data for later review, and prevents the researcher from needing to write down lengthy parameters for each document (so long as they may be recalled---posters etc. may still need to be photographed).

As such, the variables recorded are loosened, though they will still need to be collated at some point.  This will likely form a weekly or daily task.  This task should include entry into a database of the original parameters from the preliminary procedures document.

Recording Procedures
--------------------

### Digital Documents
It's impractical to sample the web without using a proxy due to the rate of page consumption, however, it's also impractical to presume that each page is read in its entirety.  A SQUID proxy will be set up to sample pages, and notes will be made at the end of a day to indicate how much of each type of page was, generally, consumed.

An upload page will be made on a public server so that digital documents, once read, may be uploaded with accompanying notes.

### Audio
The importance of audio recording cannot be underestimated, however, its use poses significant technical problems.  

Whilst audio logs are still valuable for identifying the length and type of a conversation, they are probably worth more as a reminder in conjunction with auxiliary notes.  The problem here is that speech is so informal as to make note-taking awkward.  The report document recommends one of the following:


 1. Use the dictaphone to record notes spoken to myself, including times, persons present, etc. (but otherwise record nothing)
 2. Turn the dictaphone off between conversations (might be awkward for short interactions, does not give information on time)
 3. Key the recording by using the index mark button, an audible (and visible on spectrum) 'clicker', or an in-line custom buzzer unit
 4. Develop methods for manual annotation guided by VAD

These should be investigated for practicality, and further information should be added to the second report.

### Consolidation of Data
This will take three forms:

 1. An upload page will be developed for digital documents.  This was mentioned on the first procedure document, but the preliminary sample made it seem very required.
 2. A digital diary will be created for nightly entries covering:
   * A log of events from the day
   * Details of any awkward-to-transcribe events such as the number of items purchased on a shopping trip, or the time spent driving/route
   * Information on music listened to throughout the day
   * Estimates of web page proportions read, sections of books, etc.
 3. A set of proxy logs will be recorded and demarked by blog post times.
 4. IRC logs will be recorded
 5. Terminal use logs (keylogs) will be recorded.

A day shall be the period of time prior to a blog post, from the time of the former post.
