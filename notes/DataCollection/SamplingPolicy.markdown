Sampling Policy
===============
The aim of a personal corpus is to emulate, as closely as possible, a census of observed language.

Use of language, in this context, will be defined as any conveyance of information using text (spoken or written, in any quantity).  There will be no bounds to the context in which it is used, nor the language itself, as the purpose of the study is to evaluate these very things.

Special care must be taken to respect certain edge-cases:

 * Review and Production---Both should be recorded as fully as possible.  Where a text is re-read, or developed and continually re-read, this should be noted as an ongoing process (and accordingly oversampled).
 * Short Utterances---Very short interactions, such as passing greetings, should not be under-recorded.  Their inclusion is likely to be one major difference from conventional corpora.
 * Oft-reread Texts---such as labels, signs and the like.  It's debatable whether or not one actually reads or merely remembers/recognises these.  Perhaps psychological literature (Gestalt, etc.) can shed some light on this?
