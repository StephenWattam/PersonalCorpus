Ethical Issues
==============
Certain sources of data raise various ethical and legal issues.  These are generally centred around the presumption of privacy, which applies to most direct personal interaction, as well as some more formal communications (such as email).

> The fieldworker has an ulterior motive of which his subjects are not aware when they kindly invite him to tea or shower him with Christmas cards

Many of the ethical objections posited in sociological texts apply to the misrepresentation of a field worker, leading to an asymmetric relationship between him and other participants, and necessitating various abrogations of personal and professional ethics.  These issues are essentially of no relevance to a simple and private recording process that does not entail entering any situations contrary to the researcher's normal behaviour.

Ethics Policy
-------------
The university's [ethics policy](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/resources/ethics/procedures.htm#ResearchStudents) stipulates the research must comply with all appropriate laws, and that it must not make available any identifiable information without consent.

The contents of conversations, recorded without prior knowledge, are most likely considered to contain, or potentially contain, personally identifiable information.  Collection of this information, ideally, requires informed consent (which may be retro-active) from the party being recorded.

All personally identifiable information must be stored on encrypted and private systems, and, unless explicitly agreed to, must not be disseminated to other parties.

Legal Issues
------------
My current thinking is that it's legal to record conversations for personal use.  Passing to third parties, or use for organisations bound by further legislation (such as the university) complicates that.

The following articles may have useful information in them:

 * [Recording phone calls](http://www.solidstatesound.co.uk/Telephone_rec_legal.htm#Legality%20of%20Recording%20at%20Home)
 * [Recording phone calls as a business](http://www.newbusiness.co.uk/articles/legal-advice/the-legal-ramifications-recording-conversations)
 * [A legal summary from a call recording company](http://www.itccallrecording.co.uk/legal-summary.htm)
 * [Accounting Web's opinion on call recording](http://www.accountingweb.co.uk/article/record-recording-calls-clients/517826)


A few of these have the following sentiment (quote from 'AccountingWeb'):

 > Avoiding the complicated legalese, the bottom line is this: Users of phone recording equipment do not have to tell people their call is being recorded for personal use. However, if the content of the call is to be shared with a third-party, then the caller should be made aware that a recording is being made and permission should be sought.

...though this obviously applies to phone calls, and considers ofcom rules, which are probably incompatible with face-face conversations.

Further to this:

 * [An article by Steve Mann](http://wearcam.org/sousveillance.htm)---contains some legal information, but is probably US-biased and isn't authoritative


Justification
-------------
Use of covert methods, it seems, should always be justified in terms of the importance of the research, lack of alternatives, and sensitivity of the data to be gathered.  Clearly, recording audio will require a higher standard of justification upon each of these, and the list below is written with both approximate (recording genre, setting etc) and verbatim methods in mind.

 * Eliciting consent would disrupt linguistic content, something that is minor for large interactions but makes representation of shorter utterances and conversations impossible.  Since the purpose of the study is to assess the importance of this influence on corpora, any attempts to elicit consent must be less disruptive than those used to build other corpora.
 * Without survey of all language used, it is impossible to assess the validity of hypotheses in the study.
 * Language data recorded is unlikely to be directly personally identifiable, or culturally/commercially/governmentally sensitive.  This will depend on the status and role of the researcher, of course.
 * Results may be reported without release of the data to third parties.  The lack of generalisability from having a single data point means that there is little value in releasing the data anyway.
 * The study does not centre around sociological issues, and my participation in events will not be subject to judgement or inquiry.  Simply, social issues are tangental to the content of the study (though it is notable that some readers may find more interest in them than the author intended).
